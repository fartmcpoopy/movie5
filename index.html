<p> Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest follows the events of the first Pirates movie: Curse of the Black Pearl. 
  <br>
  The movie begins on Jack's ship, the Black Pearl. Jack realizes he has "the black spot," which means Davy Jones' debt is due. He retreats to an island, grounding his ship there. The scene then switches to the lives of William and Elizabeth, who were both imprisoned by Cutler Beckett. In exchange for his freedom, Beckett proposes an offer to William: retrieve Jack's compass and you will go free. Will accepts Beckett's offer and leaves to find Jack. The story continues as Will and Jack reunite, and Jack forms an idea. He uses William to repay his debt to Jones by forcing him over to the Flying Dutchman. This leads to William finding his father, a servant to the Dutchman. The story progresses as Jack and Will fight against both Davy Jones and Cutler Beckett. In the end, Jack is unable to get past his debt, being sent to the locker by the Kraken. This sets up the plot of the third movie.
  <br>
  The movie is rated PG-13.
